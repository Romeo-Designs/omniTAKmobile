## Understanding Unit Type Codes

Your unit type is represented by a CoT (Cursor on Target) code like:

```
a-f-G-U-C-I
```

Breakdown:

- `a` = Atom (position/status)
- `f` = Friendly
- `G` = Ground
- `U` = Unit
- `C` = Combat
- `I` = Infantry

The app handles this complexity automatically - just choose your unit type from the visual picker!
